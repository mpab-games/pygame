# TODO

## Basic Functionality

### ToDo

- change the ball angle depending on where the bat is hit
- better rebound handling when hitting bricks
- bug: sometimes multiple bricks are destroyed (could be related to brick rebound handling)
- bug: sometimes the ball goes straight through the bricks
- brick positioning per level (creeps down the screen)

### Done

- basic game
- lives
- scoring
- high score
- destroy bricks
- end of level/next level handling
- sound cues
- improved game state handling, delays are no longer required
- gradient-shaded text with transparency masking

## Quality Improvements

- case handling for text input
- better sound cues
- improved graphics
- use a nicer palette
- add animations (e.g. when a brick is destroyed)
- color-fill for fonts, similar to https://www.dafont.com/press-start-2p.font

## Find better sound effects
