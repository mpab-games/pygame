## Basic Functionality

### ToDo

- high score (in progress)
- change the ball angle depending on where the bat is hit
- better rebound handling when hitting bricks
- fix bug where multipl bricks are destroyed (could be related to brick rebound handling)
- brick positioning per level (creeps down the screen)

### Done

- basic game
- lives
- scoring
- destroy bricks
- end of level/next level handling
- sound cues
- improved game state handling, delays are no longer required

## Quality Improvements

- better sound cues
- improved graphics
- use a nicer palette
